# Push Swap
*Because swap push isn't as natural*


### Summary
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

### The Rules
You have 2 stacks named `a` and `b`. The stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers which cannot be duplicated. The stack `b` is empty. The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack `a`. To do so you have the following operations at your disposal
-  sa(swap `a`): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
-  sb(swap `b`): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
-  ss:sa and sb at the same time.
-  pa(push `a`): Take the first element at the top of `b` and put it at the top of `a`. Do nothing if b is empty.
-  pb(push `b`): Take the first element at the top of `a` and put it at the top of `b`. Do nothing if a is empty.
-  ra(rotate `a`): Shift up all elements of stack `a` by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
-  rb(rotate `b`): Shift up all elements of stack `b` by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
-  rr:ra and rb at the same time.
-  rra(reverse rotate `a`): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
-  rrb(reverse rotate `b`): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
-  rrr:rra and rrb at the same time.
