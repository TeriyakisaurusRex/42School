# ft_printf
*Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() aren't enough*

Summary:
*The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf(). you will mainly learn about using ta variable number of arguments.*

## Requirements Checklist
- Don't implement the buffer management of the original **printf**
- Your function has to handle the following conversions: **cspdiuxX%**
- Your function will be compared against the original **printf**
- You must use the ar to create your library. Using the __libtool__ command is forbidden
- Your libftprintf.a has to be created at the root of your repository

we start with looking at variadic functions and how they work, first we add the `<stdarg.h>` header which contains some needed bits and bobs for variadic functions, they are four [(4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4) different methods that we can use from stdarg which are
| method | description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `va_start(va_list POINTER, ARGUMENT_NUMBER)` | we initialize a va_list struct with this so we can access the arguments e.g va_list foo; va_start(foo, argN) |
| `va_arg(va_list POINTER, TYPE)` | accesses next the next argument |
| `va_copy(va_list DESTINATION, va_list SOURCE)` | just copies the va_list |
| `va_end(va_list POINTER)` | this ends travesal of the arguments |

va_list is a struct holding the data we need.

ft_calloc a string array for the individual strings, we find how many strings we need by iterating over the string and counting the % signs (*ignoring the char after % because it could be another %*)
then we can ft_calloc the individual strings one at a time, we take the original string up to the first % and put that in our array, then pass the %+char to a function to handle the variadic part, and that will put a string into the next array box

if we don't want to start with a variadic functions we can start with a function that takes a string and looks for `%` signs and the char after it and replace/insert something into that space i.e "This %s is valid" prints "This STRING is valid" then we can connect it to the variadic functions later.


## Base Conversion
*Hex, Octal, Binary, Decimal and Arbitrary*

[Piscine Attempt](https://github.com/TeriyakisaurusRex/42Piscine/blob/main/C_04/ex04/ft_putnbr_base.c)

- Hex / Hexidecimal / base 16 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F]
- Octal / base 8 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
- Binary / base 2 = [0,1]
- Decimal / base 10 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

i hope you are noticing a pattern by now on how to count in different bases. They all start at 0 and have unique symbols for all the numbers up to their base - 1. classic arrays. we all know how to count in decimal but counting in the other bases is hard and confusing. The math for this ends up pretty simple if we use some recursion, just copy my code linked from above. Although it failed the piscine because it didn't handle negatives.

Questions?
- is accessing va_arg like access read-buffer in that it changes every time we look at it?
- how does va_end actually work?
- how does string "This %s%c%p work?" work?
- how should it handle "%%%" three percent signs in a row?

Error Handling
- "string %"  -> % char at last index of array 
- ""          -> empty string
- "\0"        -> null string
- "strin%g"   -> invalid char after % 
- test invalid arguments i.e. %c with string

Assumptions
- String is valid

Ideas
- calloc and concatenate old string with replaced parts, using ft_split and other functions
- find old base converter from piscine and use that for some of the conversions
- follow up on ft_sprintf() and ft_fprintf() 
- Give up and do it the way everyone else is doing it (not using a array to store then print)
