# ft_printf
*Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() aren't enough*

Summary:
*The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf(). you will mainly learn about using ta variable number of arguments.*

## Requirements Checklist
- Don't implement the buffer management of the original **printf**
- Your function has to handle the following conversions: **cspdiuxX%**
- Your function will be compared against the original **printf**
- You must use the ar to create your library. Using the __libtool__ command is forbidden
- Your libftprintf.a has to be created at the root of your repository

we start with looking at variadic functions and how they work, first we add the `<stdarg.h>` header which contains some needed bits and bobs for variadic functions, they are four [(4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4) different methods that we can use from stdarg which are
| method | description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `va_start(va_list POINTER, ARGUMENT_NUMBER)` | we initialize a va_list struct with this so we can access the arguments e.g va_list foo; va_start(foo, argN) |
| `va_arg(va_list POINTER, TYPE)` | accesses next the next argument |
| `va_copy(va_list DESTINATION, va_list SOURCE)` | just copies the va_list |
| `va_end(va_list POINTER)` | this ends travesal of the arguments |

va_list is a struct holding the data we need.

ft_calloc a string array for the individual strings, we find how many strings we need by iterating over the string and counting the % signs (*ignoring the char after % because it could be another %*)
then we can ft_calloc the individual strings one at a time, we take the original string up to the first % and put that in our array, then pass the %+char to a function to handle the variadic part, and that will put a string into the next array box

if we don't want to start with a variadic functions we can start with a function that takes a string and looks for `%` signs and the char after it and replace/insert something into that space i.e "This %s is valid" prints "This STRING is valid" then we can connect it to the variadic functions later.


## Base Conversion
*Hex, Octal, Binary, Decimal and Arbitrary*

[Piscine Attempt](https://github.com/TeriyakisaurusRex/42Piscine/blob/main/C_04/ex04/ft_putnbr_base.c)

- Hex / Hexidecimal / base 16 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F]
- Octal / base 8 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
- Binary / base 2 = [0,1]
- Decimal / base 10 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

i hope you are noticing a pattern by now on how to count in different bases. They all start at 0 and have unique symbols for all the numbers up to their base - 1. classic arrays. we all know how to count in decimal but counting in the other bases is hard and confusing.

Questions?
- is accessing va_arg like access read-buffer in that it changes every time we look at it?
- how does va_end actually work?
- how does string "This %s%c%p work?" work?

Error Handling
- "string %"  -> % char at last index of array 
- ""          -> empty string
- "\0"        -> null string
- "strin%g"   -> invalid char after % 
- test invalid arguments i.e. %c with string

Assumptions
- String is valid

Ideas
- calloc and concatenate old string with replaced parts, using ft_split and other functions
- find old base converter from piscine and use that for some of the conversions
- follow up on ft_sprintf() and ft_fprintf()
